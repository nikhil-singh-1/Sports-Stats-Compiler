# Sports-Stats-Complier

Using an excel file as the input, with the rows being stats from individual games, and the columns being the different stat type, the code will be able to create objects using interface for each stat and put them inside another object to organize an individual players stats. The eventual goal with this work in progress is to create a website for user to find when a player accomplishes a specific stat. i.e. Luka Doncic has a game where he has 45 points, 11 assists, and 14 rebounds, the user will want to search for what other time this stat was achieved, and using these three inputs, there will be an output displaying all the players that had that statline, with other information like the data it happened, the team they played for, the team it was against, etc.

In line 16 of the ReadExcel.java file, the location of Excel file needs to be copied and pasted to the line. The location can be found by
right clicking the Excel file and then clicking properties and then copying the location.
